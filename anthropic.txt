I can think of nothing more pressing to work on than alignment and I think Anthropic is the highest-leverage place to apply my software engineering skillset to this end. 

Also, I do like Claude, haha!

I care about alignment because I'm an OG doomer -  I read Bostrom in 2015 and have followed Eliezer since roughly then and keep up with the weekly breathtaking madness in this industry reading Zvi every week and here we are in March 2025 our civilization's strategy for bringing AGI online is still, "hope it works out, lol".

If we're all going to turn into paperclips (or some more realistic fully negative destabilizing world changes come to pass from all this tinkering) I want to do so knowing I tried to make some meaningful contribution to that not happening. 

As far as craft goes, Anthropic is working on cutting-edge problems and that appeals to the technologist in me. If there is a post-AGI world where people are still doing something, there are less-productive ways to spend my time than solving difficult technical challenges.

I like building and maintaining technical platforms and am good at it. Companies in rapid growth need flexible and maintainable systems that can absorb enough debt to get the urgent thing out the door without crippling the ability to do the next thing. I've led teams, built and maintained data-intensive backend systems, and think I've developed good senses about the endless trade-offs needed in fast-moving environments. 

If you think it'd at least be worth a chat, please reach out :)
