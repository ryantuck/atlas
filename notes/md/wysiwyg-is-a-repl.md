# WYSIWYG is a REPL

A WYSIWYG interface is a REPL, which is an extraordinarily helpful tool in programming. WYSIWYG design tools are (often?) looked down upon as toys, and I think this is for the same reason that you wouldn't treat a jupyter notebook as a production script, but it's much more efficient for hashing out thoughts.
