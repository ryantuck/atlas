# Reading

This post about [surgical reading](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/surgical-reading-how-to-read-12-books) is really neat.

Basically, get the gist of the book without reading the entire thing, and zoom in as needed.

1. Scan the index and figure out what gets a lot of play, and what you might wanna read
2. Check the table of contents, too
3. Read the preface to get the theme
4. Go as deep as necessary
