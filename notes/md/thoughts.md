# thoughts

Seeds of thought. Maybe worth dwelling on.

Dark mode for websites is especially great for people reading on their phones in bed at night. I hate how bright my goddamn phone is when I'm in a dark room but reliably sit on it for hours.

Metaphors often stronger bridges to reality than they were originally meant to be. Watch out for this.

Buddha story vs Jesus story vs other folklore - cool, what are the stories we dwell upon? What does that do to a person, to think on a specific story daily?

Western v eastern religions and cultures - has to be some undercurrent of patterns due to dominant religious paradigms and thought. Probably has been written about but would be interesting to explore to what extent.

[Choosing to be a citizen](https://seths.blog/2020/01/choosing-to-be-a-citizen/): when incentive structure is gone, are you a citizen? Or a customer?

Theories are information-efficient compressions of truth. All models are wrong, but some are useful. Models lie so you can see the truth.

World without vs with god is very different metaphysically.

Empathy - tell an offensive joke, ask how does someone in your life respond. Online really reduces default empathy from face-to-face interactions. A feature sometimes, probably a bug at other scales.

Programs have interfaces, docs, specs - how does that relate to people?

Modern world requires acknowledging and avoiding natural biases in a lot of ways - mathematics, ethics, economics, etc - what value is there in carving out parts of life where I don't need to do that?

How different would consumption of english be if there was a way to wrap concepts in parentheses, expand sentences, bounce to definitions, etc? Chrome plugin to do so? Auto-infer structure of normal english text and provide this capacity?

Do humans on net produce more suffering than less?

Sharing on Stack Overflow is wonderful. Constructive criticism in comments is helpful.

Mastodon might have taken off if it weren't just another twitter. A killer feature is needed on top of a cool protocol layer to sell it.

What is 10x better than a laptop, in the same way a laptop is 10x better than a phone for creation?

Coronavirus kind of stopped time for once. To some degree, that's been kind of nice.

Cutting things in half 3x is the same thing as 1/8, but sounds more dramatic than 1/10.

We often just memorize incantations - command line arguments, etc. Odd to think that this is "learning".

What are foundational thoughts - i.e., the thoughts that essentially comprise other more complex thoughts? Dualism, mathematics, god, etc? Higher-level thoughts or concepts (e.g. partisanism) is a weighted sum, or recipe, of more foundational thoughts. Something here about what thoughts are _atomic_.

## thoughtnugs

Thoughtnugs should be well-formed and well-formatted thoughts, ready for sharing etc.

all thoughtnugs can end up as tweets [[gtd]]

command to display N thoughtnugs every day [[gtd]]

thoughtnugs.com could be place for all sorts of uploading of thoughts from hive, tagging them, then assembling structure out of them.

## economics

Some general way of passing value on would be powerful. Solves the "I can afford to get to airport late - I end up paying more, but can go to front of lines." Importantly, the people who arrive early are compensated (financially? something else?) by this in direct proportion. [[economics]]

## Half-baked

Everyone's autistic across some dimension of mentality (???)

Is an idea a thing? in what sense does it have reality? or is it just a pattern? or are patterns what are even more fundamental than matter? or just differently fundamental?

I am partial to people liking me after reading my opinions online. Like, how many people I enjoy from New York might disown me for some particular opinion? Realistically, in-person, probably not that many that I would actually care about if they did.

Plan during planning time, and wander during wandering time.

There are tons of social opportunities that Spotify is missing out on.

How is gtd related to mommom's remembering system? Wow is playing with my ring related to dad? Pretty sure he used to do that and/or still does? Is it related literally at all?

might be the case that world has been optimized for focus, when it could equally well be optimized for lack of focus and experimentation

2020-02-20 i wonder if you could conduct network analysis by pinging various known servers within aws to determine like, how close in proximity two servers are within the same data center or something

How the fuck does bird nest building behavior pass down through generations?

Are rating changes over time reflected at all for a restaurant? Why is the interface for ratings so obscure?

Writing is exploring a space, even without having a thesis to drive home.

truth as point on 2d graph, see how it lands either positive or negative on some 1d projection, relate to multi-dimensional truth and how we all see that truth as projections onto our own lower-dimensional axes

having a tight theoretical framework of mind could help weight standardized test results correctly

No public proclamation, nothing to live up to. No skin in the game.

Artificially giving yourself skin in the game. Taking on a burden. Bearing a cross.

What are my default behaviors that others would cringe at. why? how do i get better? Not sure what this is referring to lol. (???)

iPhone cables are a racket.

Items treated as rows vs records phenomenologically different

Drywall easier to work with than plaster, relate to software - some metaphor is appropriate.

Staying unplugged for a period of time is so helpful and healthy it seems.

Learning new tools is not the fastest thing to do, but pays off on separate time scale. Tell story of local optimization. Tell story of 100x leverage. etc. Everyone knows this but make it vivid.

Innocence is powerful.

Mock up responses for live demo way ahead of implementations - dreams matter, emotional response more vivid during demo. Unclear what's a good way of mocking or if best practices have been developed.

Something to be said for having comments close to code, e.g. TODOs. Proximity ensures the edge is retained between bad code and reminder to track.

Love the surgical mask aesthetic.

What undercurrents are rumbling now that may rear themselves in 10 years? How does one see trump coming? Being woke? Etc?

Computers as leverage machines - how to 10x leverage with a computer in a novel way? 100x? or is this old hat for most people and i have just yet to catch on? that seems to be the case.

Thailand is amazing. beautiful warm weather year round, friendly people, no fucking bugs. i'd be a buddhist too if i lived around here.

Why is it so inefficient to tell a story in github? Leaving edges in the graph of life is hard work, so make it easier.

What does it actually take to unseat excel as the go-to tool?

Could live a simple life within defined limits. Could otherwise engineer reality or yourself etc.

Squirrel videos as training tool for dogs

Do other animals become entranced at music, psychedelic videos etc?

Even controlling for black white rods cones etc we could probably run fine tune experiments with dogs paying attention to moving images

Fold while sorting usually when doing laundry. What other implied orders are there and why are they there?

The ordinary, the ho hum, the everyday - it's always there to some degree. what to do about it? we don't often hear its virtues. what is great about it?

Serendipity vs focus - iterating is grid search, may find local maxima but other maximas exist. Explore vs exploit.

Other maxima always exist elsewhere.

Start with premise (conscousness is a terrain of sorts), what unintuitive philosophical things follow?

Apple wifi sharing is such a slick little usability nicety

Gotta be a fast we way to jump back one word in phone typing on keyboard like existing hard pressed functionality bit jumps words then on hover jump letters

Dignity

Just implement X - figure it out, get back to me, do something creative, sounds like a good way to learn

Virtue signaling not always bad, just depends on expected context

Discovering new ideas is a joy. how to do more?

Loving organizing means being worse at focusing tasks. maybe? how to link in N dim?

Software solutions to problems

Making a mess vs cleaning it up

Worrying about making a mess

Have strong urge to help, but tough to balance that vs contractors who i expect to come with a level of competency.

color coded text interaction like google doc, but with faster structure and interface for playing back interactions

leverage add

spreadsheet is input device - can't get over adding multiple things to one sheet. should be a diff interface. roam research for grids or something.

even choose your space. 3d. good visualization options. wow, that's a fucking sick idea. if something doesn't fit in 2D, spreadsheet shouldn't be limited. just happens to be the most useful, but should have more. should be snappy. keyboard controlled! vim bindings for working in spreadsheets - would use more spreadsheets!

that's the app. that's awesome. make it data-eng focused. wow. v cool. really fast. etc. write about the idea. blog about building the concept as i go. very cool.

how to paint a vision for people without vision

what to do during a sabbatical? cool apps. learn things. write about stuff. learn about x.

what is the utility of going veg / stopping using single-use plastic when the issues are so much more systemic?

airline pricing - why can't i negotiate with southwest for pricing on a half-full flight?

amazon big brother tracking - never hear from top performers. how bad is it?

empathy reduces the activation energy required to even engage

constant existence of text blocks in inbox as constant mental weight
how to reduce mental weight to zero

maybe playlists aren't the right datastructure for spotify? how can that interface be 10x better? spotify for hackers?

spotify api can get saved tracks - worth exploring some time maybe.
