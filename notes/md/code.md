Learn D3: https://observablehq.com/@d3/learn-d3

`ligma` is a good project name.

GitHub actions seem cool, worth playing around with.

Google SRE book: https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/

Read 12factor app.

Flame graphs for postgres explains are close to possible and would be helpful.

A sheet macro to do the following would be nifty:

- Bold headers
- Delete trailing right columns
- Freeze header
- Expand column sizes
- Turn filtering on

Generate SVG:

```
dot -Kfdp -Nfontname=Courier -Nfontsize=10 -Efontname=Courier -Efontsize=10 -T{fmt} {dot_filepath} -o {output_filepath}
```

Polyrepo world - everything is necessarily versioned. Semantic? Git SHA? Either way, deployment tooling might just say "ship out these versions of these codebases and test rigorously." This seems fairly profound - this is what testing cloud stuff in dev could be like. Providing a git SHA allows for dev branches of repos, targeting any specific commit. CI becomes the de-facto orchestration framework.

[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) is very similar to DOT / graphviz for realtime graphing. Maybe less feature-rich but is still good.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) seems really feature-rich and converts everything to everything else. One super neat feature is converting markdown to slides!

publishing iOS apps using jasonette seems really cool and simple https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jasonette

This seems like a more lightweight option than react: https://hyperapp.dev/

Get EC2 pricing easier: https://ec2.shop/ (works with `curl`).

`sudo pkill coreaudiod` resets the audio driver on mac

https://brython.info/ python3 client-side libs (i.e. replace javascript for web dev)

next.js seems worth checking out as a react-esque framework: https://nextjs.org/
