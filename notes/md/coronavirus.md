# Coronavirus

The [Our World in Data][0] site is probably the best resource for COVID-19 data.

Compiling these details primarily for sharing with my family, who complained "We don't even know who to trust anymore". If anything here's inaccurate, _please let me know so I can fix it!_

## Masks

_Update: there appears to be some evidence that viral load does matter, and that even cloth or surgical masks can reduce your exposure._ ([source][2])

Surgical and cloth masks reduce the likelihood that the _wearer_ will _transmit_ the disease by blocking large particles. _They do not meaningfully prevent the wearer from contracting COVID-19._

N95 masks filter out 95% of airborne particles. Does actually reduce exposure to the _wearer_, but official guidance is that proper fit is required, one-time-use is recommended, etc.

My take is that the CDC and WHO would be recommending these masks to everyone, but there's a global shortage and healthcare workers are the _most essential_ personnel right now, so the general public _shouldn't_ try to get N95s so they go to hospitals.
