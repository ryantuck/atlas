# Env

Ideas for making my dev env better.


- Finish syncing dev envs and detail setup in readme
- Alias for garbage commit
- Split dotfiles into areas of concern? E.g. split out git stuff.
- Always be aliasing
- Try out dropbox for bash profile / tmux stuff, symlinks instead.
- fresh terminal themes occasionally
- Infinite history
- Tmux w for windows is sweet
- Create a tmux command to clear all and to go to first available existing window
- Get SQL linting figured out
- Only lint on specific projects?
- [[vim]] - figure out typing over ending parentheses and brackets
