# Cleaning my Bookshelf

Feels like it should be a post

## Computer science

- Really great to have a cache due to lack of memory
- Faster search when organized
- Wish I had views

## Why

Why organization? It feels like a cathartic clearing. Getting the chaos of life into a manageable state does provide a high of sorts. An ability to relax.

It's now an obsession.

## Results

Okay, finished. Feels pretty good. Funny to take stock after not doing so for years.

Incomplete lists, but:

- 97 finished
- 95 started
- Roughly 300 books remaining

So roughly:

- 100 finished
- 100 started
- 300 todo
