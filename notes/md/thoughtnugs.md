# Thoughtnugs

thoughtnugs.com is a domain I now own for $14.99 a year.

So, what to do with it?

The page loads. An idea pops up on the screen. Pick from a couple interfaces, like a single idea or up to three next to one another.

Could be made cooler by pulling from a larger pool. Where are the other idea databases out there?
