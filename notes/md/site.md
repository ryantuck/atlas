## projects

- zettelkessen-vim
- gtd (could be merged)
- website zettelkessen basically works by replacing bullets with headers. probably never need to go 6 layers deep without creating separate card, arguably.

I don't need to "launch". Iterate. Start conversations.

        - nested workflowy / vimflowy thing could be really cool



could really go for some colorful headers or something via css. random header colors.

do i really not have more organized notes than this? how to diminish the overhead of organization. blazing fast input.

great graph curation interface of the web. search is good, but wandering is interesting as well. wikipedia generally has the structure. the web has the structure for god's sake.

i should have a "so you wanna learn to program" page to at least start curation.

check to see if roam has an api.

make a public bq dataset and publicize how to dimensionally model it. that's a cool idea.

opinions on data engineering, broadly. page about that. duh.

what are those opinions?



Conditionally publish [[zettelkasten]] stuff.

Let user control css for color schemes.

Micro APIs of things to show off and explain cloud infra could be neat.

Dumb birthdays to portfolio.

Merge / differentiate databae.io. Could hook all APIs etc to that.

Font needs work. Entire design needs work. Maybe go more custom css?

Public spotify playlist of good karaoke songs.

Review wayback ryantuck.io site.


Resume - Some selling point on resume things - I'm really scrappy. I'll get a prototype up fast as hell with no supervision and will do it right with an open mind to trade-offs. That seems valuable.

Write about projects. gtd and zk.

more structured guide to cool stuff on the internet

more reliable patterns for what gets published.

quotes section

new default pic some time soon

public photo albums

do - trawl twitter for site contribs t:15m

review twitter bookmarks, pocket starred articles

- Store some stuff in more structured way - even just text files that go out on deployment (books are good example here)
- Black background
- auto-gen page history
- outlines are better than blogposts in that they don't age, but you lose style.
- designs for inventions
- publish dotfiles, other greatest hits for github
- generate one-time shopping list - copy s3 file or something?
- Cleanup of gists and repos might be in order.

[[improvmx]] is the email service provider for the domain.

content/notes should populate and save in git to enable git hash history

basic way to facilitate git history is to simply provide the github history link for a given filepath.
