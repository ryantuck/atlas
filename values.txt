I've woken up in the middle of the night basically every night for the past three years for every bottle and diaper change my three babies / toddlers have needed, get up with them every single morning and play and get them fed and ready for the day, and make sure I'm there every night for dinner, bath, and bedtime. I am good at programming and am an even better dad and it's been really rewarding to step into this new life. Abstractly, I value human life and flourishing, so I suppose that's a value this aligns with, but at a more meta level I think knowing I'm partly responsible for seeding them with values makes my own decisions take on a weightier meaning, and I think this is a healthy thing for me.
