Email sent to Macrocosm re chaos economics.

Hello,

I'm an experienced software engineer with a physics degree and casual student of complexity. I read James Gleick's Chaos ten years ago and now see emergent complexity washing dirty dishes and on walks through the park. 

I'm interested in knowing if you're hiring or open to contract project work.

I heard about Macrocosm when Dr Farmer went on Econtalk and Mindscape recently to discuss chaos economics. The thesis that thinking about economics as a complex or chaotic system using agent-based modeling resonates with me and it sounds like there are more and more clients willing to bet on its utility. It sounds like a really cool project, and I love a good heterodox position!

I've proven my track record as an engineer in data-intensive applications and now want to use those skills towards efforts closer to hard math and science. I'm otherwise looking into bioinformatics or AI research roles.

If you're ever stuck on scaling your workloads in AWS or modernizing your python codebase, I'd love to help out on a challenging and meaningful project. Please don't hesitate to reach out!

Best of luck with things and happy new year!
